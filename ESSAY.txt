1. In the homework assignment, we are using character-based ngrams, i.e., the gram units are characters. Do you expect token-based ngram models to perform better?

Expect token based to do better than character based ngram models. This is based on the intuition that token-based models gives us a better distinction between the languages.

2. What do you think will happen if we provided more data for each category for you to build the language models? What if we only provided more data for Indonesian?

If we were given more training data, We would be able to predict the language of a given piece of unlabelled input with higher confidence/accuracy.

If we were only given more data for Indonesian, I suspect that we will do better overall as well, though not as well if we got less data but more evenly spread out.

3. What do you think will happen if you strip out punctuations and/or numbers? What about converting upper case characters to lower case?

I think that this might give us more accuracy for certain languages. This also depends on whether we are using a character based ngram model or a token based on.

I'd expect this change to work better for a token based ngram model.

===

4. We use 4-gram models in this homework assignment. What do you think will happen if we varied the ngram size, such as using unigrams, bigrams and trigrams?

I think that, especially for our character based ngram model, using larger n helps to improve accuracy. (up to a reasonable length).
